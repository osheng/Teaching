# ClassGradeCalculator

I teach a Chinese class and I wanted a quick way to calculate my students'
grades and to be able to weight their higher-mark work more favourably.
So I came up with this program which takes in a csv file (with some formatting constraints)
and prints out the students' grades and warns me of any work that they may have not handed in.
The csv file in this repository is an example of what the py file would take as input.

This somewhat less than beautifully written script was written at a time when
one of my goals was to practice certain basic manipulations like reading a csv
with readline. To this extent, using a library like Pandas would have 
defeated the point.
