### Teaching
This repository contains a collection of tools which I've created to facilitate
administrative tasks which come up in teaching.
* split_csv.py &mdash; to split a folder of CSV files each into several smaller CSV files based on their contents
* ClassGradeCalculator &mdash; to compute from CSV the final grades for students based on the marks of all their evaluations
