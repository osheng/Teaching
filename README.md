# ClassGradeCalculator

I teach a Chinese class and I wanted a quick way to calculate my students'
grades and to be able to weight their higher-mark work more favourably. 
So I came up with this program which takes in a csv file (with some formatting constraints) 
and prints out the students' grades and warns me of any work that they may have not handed in.
